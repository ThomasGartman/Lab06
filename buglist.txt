It is clear that there are four bugs:
1. isEmpty() is always returning true.
2. AddBack() is not implemented correctly. It appears to be adding numbers into the list (see the search tests) but not in the correct order.
3. RemoveFront() is not implemented correctly. It fails to remove any number on a list of size 1 or greater.
4. RemoveBack() is not implemented correctly. It fails to remove any number on a list of size 1 or greater.

It would appear that both RemoveFront() and RemoveBack() rely on isEmpty() to determine whether or not to attempt a deletion of a node. This implies that fixing isEmpty() would likely fix RemoveFront() and RemoveBack(). After fixing isEmpty(), rerun this script to determine if that fixed RemoveFront() and RemoveBack() or not.

Further, there would be an issue where RemoveFront() and RemoveBack() will not result in the correct result if AddBack() is used to add integers to the list.

Also, the .o file ran on the lab machines but not on my Ubuntu 18.04 machine at home. I got error: "Relocation R_X86_64_32 against symbol '_ZTV16LinkedListOfInts' cannot be used when making a PIE object.'
